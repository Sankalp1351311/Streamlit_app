### A Test Application

This here is a test project for Streamlit library of python that allows you to create basic dhashboards and test applications for your models and codes in order to display them before you move forward with proper application and deployment. 

All it requires is to install python first that can be done directly from the web, prefrably Python-3.10 or higher. 

Thereafter, the streamlit library must be installed using the terminal command line,

"pip install streamlit"

and you can go throught the documentation as well to learn how you can explore and use it to for your requirements. As the streamlit community server allows you to easily deploy the application as well, its a basic requirement to push the project to GitHub first.
